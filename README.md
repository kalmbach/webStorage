# webStorage

These is a collection of adapters for the HTML5 Web Storage technologies: localStorage, IndexedDB and WebSqlDB.
All adapters have the same API, making really easy to interchange them based on the browser support.

The intention here is provide a reliable way of using web storage without worrying about browser inner details.
